  * Fix a couple of mistakes brought to light to publisuing buffers.
    Namely: a one-off false alarm in serializeInt; and accidentally
    writing two bytes for a frame end, because 206 isn't an ascii char.
  * Handle empty queue names (used to indicate that the server should
    generate a random name).
  * Enable the ability to publish to the default exchange; that is, the
    exchange with the empty name that is used to publish directly to
    queues.
  * Update the readme after my changes; in particular wrt the default
    exchange. Pass the name in the queue creation callback, as it may
    have been generated and returned by the server.
  * Give all message properties to the subscriber.  Also allow options
    to connection.publish, which seems to have been arbitrarily missed
    out.
  * Support multiple consumers on a single connection. Previously, node-
    amqp would add subscribers to the listeners, which meant rather than
    the particular subscriber callback being called, every subscriber
    callback was called.  Now they are distinguished by consumer tag (we
    supply our own, so we don't have to wait for the server to tell us
    its generated one, which is awkward in CPS). You can still get the
    raw messages by listening for rawMessage rather than using
    subscribe*.
  * Allow channels (queues, exchanges) to be closed
